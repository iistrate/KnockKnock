 Write a Java Client and Server to simulate Knock-Knock Jokes.  The sequence should go like this:

Client connects to server
Knock Knock - server
Who's there? - client
Joke - server
Joke Who - client
Punchline - server

Disconnect from server.

Your server should have several jokes and should have input error checking.
